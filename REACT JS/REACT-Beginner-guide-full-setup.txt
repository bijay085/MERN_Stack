How to setup REACT things beginner guide.?

-> Move to any drive (let say D)
-> Download vs code and its extension (es7+ and css intellisense)
-> Create new folder (suppose reactpractice)

There are 2 method , with vite and without vite 
**Without vite**
(if folder not created)
-> mkdir reactpractice
-> cd reactpractice

-> npm init -y
-> npm install react react-dom
->npm start

Basic setup without advanced features.
Requires more manual configuration and setup to achieve the same level of functionality provided by Vite out-of-the-box.

**With vite**

-> cd reactpractice
-> npm install
-> npm run dev


Now setting up cra (CREATE REACT APP)
**With CRA**

-> npm start

**React project with vite**
-> npm create vite@latest reactpractice
Project name: reactpractice
Select a framework: React
Select a variant: JavaScript
-> cd reactpractice
-> npm install
-> npm run dev


Configuration
**CRA:**
Uses Webpack and Babel under the hood.
Comes with a pre-configured build and development setup that covers most common use cases.
Customization often requires ejecting the configuration (npm run eject), which exposes the underlying configuration files.

**Vite:**
Uses Rollup for production builds and esbuild for development, providing faster builds and HMR.
Easier to configure and extend with plugins.
Minimal setup out-of-the-box, with a focus on modern JavaScript features


**Summary**
Without Vite: Basic setup without advanced features. Requires more manual configuration and setup to achieve the same level of functionality provided by Vite out-of-the-box.
With Vite: Provides a streamlined and efficient development experience with fast builds and HMR.
With CRA: Offers a robust and comprehensive setup with more built-in features but can be more complex to customize.
